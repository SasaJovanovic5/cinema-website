# Cinema website

A project for college where we were asked to create a website in PHP. I decided to create a website for a "local" theater.
The websites shows movies that are showing on the current day and you can search which movies are showing on a select day. It also has upcoming movies that get added to the roster of movies that are showing as soon as the date for release passes. 

For each movie you can see a description, genre and length. 

There are 3 types of users: admin, user and guest.

Admin can add showings (add.php) as well as new movies (dodajProjekcije.php). 

A user is someone who has an account on the website. They can create an account (registracija.php), and then log in(prijava.php). As a user you can buy tickets and leave reviews on movies (pregledFilma). 

Guest can only browse the site and can't buy tickets or leave reviews.

The seat picker does not work at the moment.

The content of the website is written in Slovenian.
